        <h4>Client Description:</h4>
        <p>
          Dutch Bangla Bank was the first bank in Bangladesh to be fully
          automated. The Electronic-Banking Division was established in 2002 to
          undertake rapid automation and bring modern banking services into this
          field. Full automation was completed in 2003 and hereby introduced
          plastic money to the Bangladeshi masses. Dutch Bangla Bank also
          operates the nation's largest ATM fleet and in the process drastically
          cut consumer costs and fees by 80%. Moreover, Dutch Bangla Bank
          choosing the low profitability route for this sector has surprised
          many critics. Dutch Bangla Bank had pursued the mass automation in
          Banking as a CSR activity and never intended profitability from this
          sector. As a result, it now provides unrivaled banking technology
          offerings to all its customers. Because of this mindset, most local
          banks have joined Dutch Bangla Bank banking infrastructure instead of
          pursuing their own.
